Chris:  

As we discussed yesterday, Laird and I spoke and we think that the 
presentation is good to go for Thursday.  We'll need to update the numbers 
for the offer we made to S.D. last week.  You had mentioned that you might 
want to include a shaped product.  You still considering it?  Let us know and 
we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.

My flight gets into S.D. at at 8:35 on southwest.

Best,
Jeff
