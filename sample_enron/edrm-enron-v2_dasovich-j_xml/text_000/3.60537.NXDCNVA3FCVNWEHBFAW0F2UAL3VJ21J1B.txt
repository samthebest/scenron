Mr. Myers,
My name is Jeff Fawcett.  I am a commercial representative of Transwestern 
Pipeline Co. and was its witness during the recent GIR proceedings.  Given 
Transwestern's role as one of the principal suppliers of natural gas to the 
State of California, we are very interested in the outcome of these 
proceedings and offer our assistance to the Commission in its investigation.

Much has been discussed in the press recently about pipeline infrastructure 
in California, as well as the upstream capacity of FERC pipes that serve the 
California marketplace.  I know there is much to be covered in the 4/17 
workshop.  However, if the schedule permits, Transwestern would like to offer 
a brief overview of its delivery system to California and its view of the key 
issues the Commission and stakeholders face as the investigation moves 
forward.  TW,s presentation should take no more than 10-15 minutes.

Please let me know if the Energy Division would like TW to make such a 
presentation and, if possible, approximately what point during the 9 -4:30 
session Transwestern will be invited to step forward.  I,m available by 
return email or you may reach me by telephone at 713-853-1521.  Thank you.
