Hi there,

A brief farewell......   

Today, Friday the 13th,  is my departure date to the tombstones of Egypt, 
please wish me luck.

I will be roughing it out for the next month on trains, planes, boats, tennis 
shoes and a backpack on my back.  What started out as an easy, pleasant and 
classy 4-star hotel kind of trip ended up as a low budget, high impact trip 
to cover more grounds and to keep spending in check.  No rocks will be 
unturned.

I am taking requests for light-weight souvenirs from France (Paris, Nice, the 
French Alps), Switzerland (Lake Geneva), Greece (Athens, Mykonos, Crete), and 
Egypt (Alexandria to  Aswan).  This is a bribe for being away from work for a 
month without a laptop.  Sorry, I don't think I can access email on trains.

I will check voice messages and email through my vickyha@onebox.com account 
periodically.  If all is well, I will be back in the office May 14th.


Vicky
