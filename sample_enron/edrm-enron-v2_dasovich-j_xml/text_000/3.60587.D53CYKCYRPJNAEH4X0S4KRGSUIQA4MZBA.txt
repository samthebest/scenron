good question.  They may be anticipating a lengthy presentation by the LDC's 
that answers the questions posed on the notice.  I just sent you what I 
propose TW should handout.  Look over and let me know what you think.  It's 
short, only 8 pages.  I thought brevity would be refreshing.  Thanks, dude.  
Have a great Easter weekend.

This is unreal.  If TW ain't on the A list, who is?
