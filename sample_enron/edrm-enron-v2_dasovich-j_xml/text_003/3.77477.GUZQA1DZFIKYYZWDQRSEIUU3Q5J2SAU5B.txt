Can you make sure that the EES is looped in to the call?  Neil, I've heard 
that FERC may move the meeting to Friday.

Will you make sure we are in the loop with the FERC meeting on the 13th ?  We 
may want our own log in down here on the desk. Can you let us know how that 
is done and what the cost is. 

Thanks
