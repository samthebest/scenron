Probably no need to reiterate here (it just makes me feel better), but the date of the bill signing or September 1 is MUCH MUCH preferable to EES. We have substantial contracts that we executed at the end of August.

·	On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee.
·	The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
·	Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
·	The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
·	In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
·	The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
·	We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
·	We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

·	The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
·	If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
·	It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
·	If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
·	That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
·	Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff
